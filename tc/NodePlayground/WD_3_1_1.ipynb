We'll explore how to build back-end servers using Express.js, how to work with databases, and how to use best practices to ensure security. You'll learn about essential concepts such as authentication and authorization, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), containerization, and finally, how to deploy your server. Get ready to dive deep into the world of back-end development!\n",

You'll learn what a server is and what a back-end stack consists of and familiarize yourself with some common back-end terminology. We'll also introduce you to Node.js, a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript on your server. By the end of this part, you'll have a foundation to build upon in the following parts when we will introduce you to relational databases.\n",

For example, we can have an optimized web server application, such as Nginx or Apache, handling our requests. It could resolve requests for static files, such as static HTML, CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript, and forward requests for dynamic content to a Node.js server. This is a typical setup for production applications called a **reverse proxy**. However, in development environments, using a single Node.js server to handle all requests is common.\n",

In recent years, Node has been moving towards adopting new web standards, such as the `fetch` API. But in some cases, Node has modules that serve the same purpose as the browser-native options based on web standards. For example, Node has `crypto` and `Stream`, which have similar roles to `Crypto` and `Stream` available in the browser. In Node, these tend to be referenced as \"Node APIs\" and \"Web APIs\". For example, [Node Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) and [Web Crypto in Node](https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html). The good news is that 99% of the time, you do not need to rely on Node-exclusive APIs; most of the time, it will be clear which one is being used. Most tutorials and documentation will refer to the Node APIs when dealing with Node.\n",
